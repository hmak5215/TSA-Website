			<h4 class="title">About TSA</h4>
			<p><b>What is TSA?</b><br/>The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national organization of students engaged in science,
			 technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Open to students enrolled in or who have completed technology education
			  courses, TSA's membership includes over 233,000 middle and high school students in approximately 2,000 schools spanning
			   49 states. TSA is supported by educators, parents and business leaders who believe in the need for a technologically
			    literate society. Members learn through exciting competitive events, leadership opportunities and much more.
			     The diversity of activities makes TSA a positive experience for every student. From engineers to business managers,
			      our alumni credit TSA with a positive influence on their lives.
			      <br/>
			<b>Mission Statement</b>
			<br/>
			The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM,
			 whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.
			 <br/>
			 <b>Motto</b><br/>
			 Learning to lead in a technical world</p>
			 
			<h4 class="title" id="here">Design Brief - Augmented Reality</h4>
			<p><b>What is Augmented Reality?</b> Augmented reality is the merging of the real world and computer generated images.
			 Sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, or gps data can change our reality and enhance our way of living.
			 <br/><b>Current Uses</b> Pokemon Go is the most popular AR game on the app store. The game lets people catch pokemon
			  in real life by swiping up and down on a simulated 3d pokemon using the phone's camera.
			  <br/>Bentley systems has created a heads-up system that makes blueprints come to life for construction companies.
			   This saves paper and time since construction workers have instructions literally right in front of them.
			   <br/>Google translate now has a feature that can translate text in the real world. By pointing your camera at foreign
			    text such as on a sign, it can translate and replace the text with english.<br/>
			<b>Pros of Augmented Reality</b> Augmented reality has the potential to make us more knowledgeable through descriptions
			 of objects and location that pop up in gps systems. It can also help people learn through simulations closely related to real life.
			 <br/>
			 <b>Cons of Augmented Reality</b> While using a software with augmented reality, they may be able to track anywhere you go. As technology
			 grows better and it becomes more real looking, some people may get carried away and prefer using augmented reality instead of reality.
			 <br/><b>Future Use</b> The main use of augmented reality today is gaming, but it will eventually be spread to much more than that. It could
			 be used to view the finished product of something before it has been built, for example, seeing a constructed building without building anything at all, make movies seem more real, 
			 and maybe help with mental disorders with something like Iron Man which helps direct the user where to go.</p>
