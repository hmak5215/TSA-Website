			<p><b>Introduction to Engineering Design </b>Students dig deep into the engineering design process, applying math, science, and engineering
standards to hands-on projects. They work both individually and in teams to design solutions to a variety
of problems using 3D modeling software, and use an engineering notebook to document their work.</p><br>

<p><b>Principles of Engineering </b>Through problems that engage and challenge, students explore a broad range of engineering topics,
including mechanisms, the strength of structures and materials, and automation. Students develop skills
in problem solving, research, and design while learning strategies for design process documentation,
collaboration, and presentation.</p><br>

<p><b>Aerospace Engineering </b>This course propels students' learning in the fundamentals of atmospheric and space flight. As they
explore the physics of flight, students bring the concepts to life by designing an airfoil, propulsion system,
and rockets. They learn basic orbital mechanics using industry-standard software. They also explore
robot systems through projects such as remotely operated vehicles.</p><br>

<p><b>Civil Engineering and Architecture </b>Students learn important aspects of building and site design and development. They apply math, science,
and standard engineering practices to design both residential and commercial projects and document
their work using 3D architecture design software.</p><br>

<p><b>Computer Integrated Manufacturing </b>Manufactured items are part of everyday life, yet most students have not been introduced to the hightech,
innovative nature of modern manufacturing. This course illuminates the opportunities related to
understanding manufacturing. At the same time, it teaches students about manufacturing processes,
product design, robotics, and automation. Students can earn a virtual manufacturing badge recognized
by the National Manufacturing Badge system.</p><br>

<p><b>Digital Electronics </b>From smartphones to appliances, digital circuits are all around us. This course provides a foundation for
students who are interested in electrical engineering, electronics, or circuit design. Students study topics
such as combinational and sequential logic and are exposed to circuit design tools used in industry,
including logic gates, integrated circuits, and programmable logic devices.</p><br>

<p><b>Engineering Design and Development </b>The knowledge and skills students acquire throughout PLTW Engineering come together in Engineering
Design and Development as they identify an issue and then research, design, and test a solution,
ultimately presenting their solution to a panel of engineers. Students apply the professional skills they
have developed to document a design process to standards, completing Engineering Design and
Development ready to take on any post-secondary program or career.</p><br>

<p><b>AP Computer Science</b> This course is a follow up class to Intro to Computer Programming. It goes beyond what was learned in the intro class and teaches Java programming. This is an AP class so an AP test is offered that can give college credit.</p> <br>

<p><b>Introduction to Web Programming </b>Students learn the basics of how to build a website.They are introduced to the core programing languages,
 html5, CSS, and Javascript. They learn critical thinking skills through solving errors in their own code.</p><br>

<p><b>Introduction to Computer Programming</b> This class coveres the basics of computer programming including logic and coding principles using programs like Alice and Greenfoot that expose the students to coding without actual typing code.</p><br>

<p><b>Advanced Web Programming </b>This course expands on students knowledge of Web programing. Students learn to design websites, as well as front end and back end development. Working together is important to completing assignments within a given time period.</p><br>

<p><b>Computer Architecture</b> Students enrolled in this course will learn about the inside of a computer. Students get the opportunity to have a hands-on experience learning about the components of a computer.</p><br>
