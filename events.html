			<p>Below are a few descriptions of some events offered at
			 TSA competitions. The full list can be found in the 2017
			 & 2018 High School Technology Activities, National TSA
			 Conference Competitive Events Guide</p>
			 
			<p>
			<b>3D Animation Participants</b> (three teams of two members per state) 
			demonstrate their knowledge of 3D animation technology and design skills
			to creatively solve the challenge posted on the national TSA website.
			Animatronics Participants (one team per chapter) demonstrate knowledge of mechanical
 			and control systems by designing, fabricating, and controlling an animatronics device
  			that will communicate, entertain, inform, demonstrate and/or illustrate a topic, idea,
   			subject, or concept. Sound, lights, and a surrounding environment must accompany the device.
			</br></br>

			<b>Architectural Design Participants</b> (one team, or one individual, per chapter; one entry
 			per team or individual) develop a set of architectural plans and related materials for
  			an annual architectural design challenge and construct a physical, as well as a computer-generated
   			model, to accurately depict their design.
			</br></br>

			<b>Biotechnology Design Participants</b> (three teams of two to six members per state) select a 
			contemporary biotechnology problem (that relates to the current year's published topic) and
 			demonstrate understanding of it through documented research, the development of a solution,
  			a display (including an optional model or prototype), and an effective multimedia presentation.
			</br></br>

			<b>Coding Participants</b> (one individual, or one team of two to three members, per chapter)
 			respond to an annual coding-related design challenge by developing a software program
  			that will accurately address an on-site problem in a specified, limited amount of time.
			</br></br>

			<b>Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Architecture Participants</b> (two individuals per state) use
 			complex computer graphic skills, tools, and processes to develop representations of 
 			architectural subjects, such as foundation and/or floor plans, and/or elevation drawings,
 			and/or details of architectural ornamentation or cabinetry.
			</br></br>

			<b>Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Engineering Participants</b> (two individuals per state) use 
			complex computer graphic skills, tools, and processes to develop three-dimensional 
			representations of engineering subjects such as a machine part, tool, device, or manufactured product.
			</br></br>

			<b>Debating Technological Issues Participants</b> (three teams of two members per state) work
 			together to prepare for a debate against a team from another chapter. The teams will 
 			be instructed to take either the Pro or Con side of a selected subtopic.
			</br></br>

			<b>Engineering Design Participants</b> (three teams of three or more members per state) develop
 			a solution to a National Academy of Engineering grand challenge that is posted on the 
 			national TSA website. The solution offered will be informed and designed by precise problem
  			definition, thorough research, creativity, experimentation (when possible), and the development
   			of documents and appropriate models (mathematical, graphical, and/or physical prototype/model).
    		Semifinalist teams present and defend their proposed solution to a panel of evaluators.
			</br></br>

			<b>Music Production Participants</b> (three teams per state; an individual may participate solo in this
 			team event) produce an original musical piece that is designed to be played during the national
  			TSA conference opening or closing general sessions.
			</br></br>

			<b>Photographic Technology Participants</b> (one individual per chapter) demonstrate understanding of 
			and expertise in using photographic and imaging technology processes to convey a message based on
 			a theme. Semifinalists record images and then utilize graphic editing software to prepare a single 
 			final image as a solution to an on-site prompt.
			</br></br>

			<b>Promotional Design Participants</b> (three individuals per state) use computerized graphic communications 
			layout and design skills in the production of a promotional resource for TSA.
			</br></br>

			<b>Structural Design and Engineering Participants</b> (one team of two members per chapter) work as a 
			team to build a designated structure that is posted on the TSA website. Teams apply the principles
 			of structural design and engineering through research, design, construction, destructive testing,
  			and assessment to determine the design efficiency of the structure.
			</br></br>

			<b>Video Game Design Participants</b> (three teams per state, with a minimum of two members per team)
 			develop a game that focuses on the subject of their choice. The game must have high artistic, 
 			educational, and social value and be interesting, exciting, visually appealing, and intellectually challenging.
			</br></br>

			<b>Webmaster Participants</b> (one team of three to five members per chapter) design, build, and launch
 			a website that features the school's career and technology/engineering program, the TSA chapter, 
 			and the chapter's ability to research and present a given topic pertaining to technology. Semifinalists
 			participate in an on-site interview to demonstrate the knowledge and expertise gained during the development
  			of the website â€” with an emphasis on web design methods and practices, as well as their research for the annual design topic.</p>
