					<h1>What is TSA?</h1>
					<p>
						The Technology Student Association (TSA) is a national organization of students engaged in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Open to students enrolled in or who have completed technology education courses, TSA's membership includes over 233,000 middle and high school students in approximately 2,000 schools spanning 49 states. TSA is supported by educators, parents and business leaders who believe in the need for a technologically literate society. Members learn through exciting competitive events, leadership opportunities and much more. The diversity of activities makes TSA a positive experience for every student. From engineers to business managers, our alumni credit TSA with a positive influence on their lives. 
					</p>
				
				
					<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
					<p>
						The Technology Student Association enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in STEM, whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.

					<h1> State Competition </h1>
					<p> Each year, every TSA club has the opportunity to attend their corresponding state competition. These competitions occur at the end of the school year. This year, the Missouri state competition will be held at Missouri S&T in Rolla, Missouri. </p>
					<h1> National Competition </h1>
					<p> The winners of each event in the state competition are able to attend the National TSA Conference in Orlando, Florida. There are many activities to take part in that will help develop their skills in STEM fundamentals. </p>

					<h1> Events </h1>
					<p> <b> 3D Animation Participants </b> (three teams of two members per state) demonstrate their knowledge of 3D animation technology and design skills to creatively solve the challenge posted on the national TSA website. Animatronics Participants (one team per chapter) demonstrate knowledge of mechanical and control systems by designing, fabricating, and controlling an animatronics device that will communicate, entertain, inform, demonstrate and/or illustrate a topic, idea, subject, or concept. Sound, lights, and a surrounding environment must accompany the device. </p>
					<p> <b> Architectural Design Participants </b> (one team, or one individual, per chapter; one entry per team or individual) develop a set of architectural plans and related materials for an annual architectural design challenge and construct a physical, as well as a computer-generated model, to accurately depict their design. </p>
					<p> <b> Biotechnology Design Participants </b> (three teams of two to six members per state) select a contemporary biotechnology problem (that relates to the current year's published topic) and demonstrate understanding of it through documented research, the development of a solution, a display (including an optional model or prototype), and an effective multimedia presentation. </p>
					<p> <b> Coding Participants </b> (one individual, or one team of two to three members, per chapter) respond to an annual coding-related design challenge by developing a software program that will accurately address an on-site problem in a specified, limited amount of time. </p>
					<p> <b> Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Architecture Participants </b> (two individuals per state) use complex computer graphic skills, tools, and processes to develop representations of architectural subjects, such as foundation and/or floor plans, and/or elevation drawings, and/or details of architectural ornamentation or cabinetry. </p>
					<p> <b> Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Engineering Participants </b> (two individuals per state) use complex computer graphic skills, tools, and processes to develop three-dimensional representations of engineering subjects such as a machine part, tool, device, or manufactured product. </p>
					<p> <b> Debating Technological Issues Participants </b> (three teams of two members per state) work together to prepare for a debate against a team from another chapter. The teams will be instructed to take either the Pro or Con side of a selected subtopic. </p>
					<p> <b> Engineering Design Participants </b> (three teams of three or more members per state) develop a solution to a National Academy of Engineering grand challenge that is posted on the national TSA website. The solution offered will be informed and designed by precise problem definition, thorough research, creativity, experimentation (when possible), and the development of documents and appropriate models (mathematical, graphical, and/or physical prototype/model). Semifinalist teams present and defend their proposed solution to a panel of evaluators. </p>
					<p> <b> Music Production Participants </b> (three teams per state; an individual may participate solo in this team event) produce an original musical piece that is designed to be played during the national TSA conference opening or closing general sessions. </p>
					<p> <b>  Photographic Technology Participants </b> (one individual per chapter) demonstrate understanding of and expertise in using photographic and imaging technology processes to convey a message based on a theme. Semifinalists record images and then utilize graphic editing software to prepare a single final image as a solution to an on-site prompt. </p> 
					<p> <b>  Promotional Design Participants </b> (three individuals per state) use computerized graphic communications layout and design skills in the production of a promotional resource for TSA. </p> 
					<p> <b>  Structural Design and Engineering Participants </b> (one team of two members per chapter) work as a team to build a designated structure that is posted on the TSA website. Teams apply the principles of structural design and engineering through research, design, construction, destructive testing, and assessment to determine the design efficiency of the structure. </p> 
					<p> <b>  Video Game Design Participants </b> (three teams per state, with a minimum of two members per team) develop a game that focuses on the subject of their choice. The game must have high artistic, educational, and social value and be interesting, exciting, visually appealing, and intellectually challenging. </p> 
					<p> <b>  Webmaster Participants </b> (one team of three to five members per chapter) design, build, and launch a website that features the school's career and technology/engineering program, the TSA chapter, and the chapter's ability to research and present a given topic pertaining to technology. Semifinalists participate in an on-site interview to demonstrate the knowledge and expertise gained during the development of the website â€” with an emphasis on web design methods and practices, as well as their research for the annual design topic. </p>
